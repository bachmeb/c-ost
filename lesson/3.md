##### Make a project directory
    mkdir ~/git/c-ost/three

##### Change to the new directory
    ~/git/c-ost/three

##### Make a new file
    vim three.c
```c
/* three.c */

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){

  /* print statement */
  printf("Keep on rockin in the free world.\n");

  return(1);
}
```

##### Install GCC
    sudo yum install gcc

##### Compile the code
    gcc -o three three.c

##### List the contents of the project directory
    ls -la

##### Run the application
    ./three
```c
// Keep on rockin in the free world
```

##### Take the semicolon off the end of the printf statement
    vim three.c
```c
/* three.c */

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){

  /* print statement */
  printf("Keep on rockin in the free world.\n")

  return(1);
}
```

##### Recompile
    gcc -o three three.c
```c
/*
three.c: In function ‘main’:
three.c:10:3: error: expected ‘;’ before ‘return’
   return(1);
   ^
*/
```
##### Run the application
*The application that was previously compiled hasn't been touched and is still runnable.*
```
./three
```
```c
// Keep on rockin in the free world
```
